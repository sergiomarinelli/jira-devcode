Hi, I’m Sérgio 👋 — a former developer turned Jira & Jira Service Management specialist.

**Jira DevCode** is my corner of the internet to share *engineering-grade* Jira knowledge: the kind you build after years of creating workflows, automations, and integrations that need to survive real-world chaos.

## What this blog is about
A lot of Jira content is “click here, then click there”. Helpful? Sure.  
But when you’re responsible for keeping things clean, scalable, and predictable across teams, you need more than UI tips.

Here, we go a level deeper into the technical layer of Jira Cloud and JSM:

- Automation patterns (safe, maintainable, and repeatable)
- JQL that actually scales
- Workflows and permission models that don’t become a nightmare later
- REST APIs, webhooks, and integrations
- Assets/CMDB data modeling and governance
- Troubleshooting, edge cases, and “why is this happening?”

## What you can expect
- **Deep dives** (without the fluff)
- **Copy/paste-ready snippets** (JQL, JSON payloads, scripts)
- **Practical patterns** you can apply immediately
- Notes on **pitfalls** I wish someone had warned me about

## Who it’s for
If you’re a Jira admin, service management specialist, analyst, or developer who likes to understand *how things work under the hood*, you’re in the right place.

## Community-first
My goal is simple: help more people build Jira setups that are **cleaner, safer, and easier to evolve** — and make advanced Jira knowledge more accessible.

If you want to collaborate, suggest topics, or just say hi, feel free to reach out on GitHub or LinkedIn. 🚀
