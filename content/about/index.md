Hi, I’m Sérgio — a former developer and a Jira/JSM specialist.

**Jira DevCode** is my place to share *engineering-grade* Jira knowledge: the kind of content you usually only find when you mix product expertise with a developer mindset.

## Why this blog exists
Most Jira content stops at “how to click through the UI”. That’s useful, but it doesn’t help when you need to build solutions that are:

- scalable (across squads, projects, and service desks)
- reliable (idempotent automations, safe retries, predictable outcomes)
- maintainable (clean workflow architecture, naming conventions, patterns)
- observable (logs, metrics, dashboards, and debugging strategies)

Here I focus on the **technical layer** behind Jira Cloud and Jira Service Management:
JQL, automation patterns, REST APIs, webhooks, integrations, data modeling, and troubleshooting.

## What you can expect
- **Deep-dives** (not just basics)
- **Copy/paste-ready** examples (JQL, JSON payloads, scripts)
- **Real-world patterns** for workflows and automation design
- Notes on **pitfalls and edge cases** I’ve hit in production

## Who it’s for
If you’re a Jira admin, service management specialist, analyst, or developer who likes to understand *how things work under the hood*, you’ll feel at home here.

## Community-first
My goal is simple: **raise the technical bar** of Jira content and help the community build better systems—faster, safer, and with less guesswork.
